Subject: <b>Programming in C</b> <br>
Semester: <b>1</b> <br>
Year: <b>2021</b>

This repository contains:
* C Programs
* Lab Record

back from Semester 1 of University.

I must admit, I belive that I have <b>gained a better understanding of Algorithms and Programming in C</b> over the years, than when I was in the first semester.

I learned good coding practices such as:
* <b>Describing the code functionality</b> at the top of the file.
* <b>Adding docstrings</b> to functions with expected input, output, and examples.
* <b>Writing modular algorithms</b>. Algorithms are programming language agnostic.
* <b>Validating function inputs</b> - e.g. checking for NULL pointers.
* <b>Handling user input exceptions</b> gracefully to uphold code sanity - especially datatype mismatch, & excess arguments.
